# SLO hackers and coders Tinkering with the YouTube api

I met up with the [slo hackers and coders meetup](http://www.meetup.com/SLO-Hackers-and-Coders/) and we tinkered with the YouTube API. 

## How It works

We make an ajax call to the youtube api servers and request a specific data back. From there I received a JSON response that had the videoId and updated the src of a embedded iframe on my page. 

You were able to toggle between the top 10 most popular entertainment videos on youtube in a 'teaser' category.
